I am currently a <a href = "https://profiles.stanford.edu/ashley-blawas"> Postdoctoral Researcher</a> in the Goldbogen Lab at <a href="https://hopkinsmarinestation.stanford.edu/"> Stanford University</a>. My research focuses on the physiological traits that underpin  metabolic function in baleen whales using engineering and molecular biology tools.  I work across multiple scales of biological organization, from organism to organ system, tissue, and cell, to understand how animals sustain physiological function at the limits of organismal performance. I work on answering questions about drivers of oxygen/nutrient transport, limits to metabolic function in oxygen/nutrient-limited behavioral states and environments, and how adaptations to these challenges differ across organisms during acute versus chronic oxygen/nutrient stress. 

I completed by Ph.D. in Marine Science in the <a href="https://sites.nicholas.duke.edu/nowacek/"> Nowacek Lab </a> at <a href="https://nicholas.duke.edu/marinelab"> Duke University</a> and obtained my B.S.E in Biomedical Engineering from Duke University's <a href="https://pratt.duke.edu/"> Pratt School of Engineering. </a>

In addition to research, I have focused on developing my teaching abilities as part of my training. I pursued a <a href="https://gradschool.duke.edu/professional-development/programs/certificate-college-teaching">Certificate in College Teaching</a> during which I took courses in pedagogy, course design, and college teaching.  I have experience instructing course, creating and giving lectures, and leading lab exercises on topics within the field of physiology to a diverse array of students from specialized courses like Comparative Physiology of Marine Animals to general courses like Marine Megafauna. I have also enhanced my science communication skills and community engagment through outreach programs like <a href="https://sites.duke.edu/gest/">Growing Equity in Science and Technology</a> and <a href="https://www.skypeascientist.com/">Skype a Scientist</a>.
