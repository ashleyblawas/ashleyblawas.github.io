The Marine Mammal Acoustics and Spatial Ecology (MAPS) project was funded by BOEM and led by Drs. Doug Nowacek (Duke) and Ann Pabst (UNCW). The project had four components whose outputs are summarized in the <a href="assets/pdf/BOEM MAPS Report 2023.pdf">final project report</a>:

(1) Visual and passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) of cetaceans across a section of the Mid-Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf (OCS)
(2) Improvements to opensource tag visualization software
(3) Streamlining of citizen science data-gathering technologies, and
(4) Communication and outreach efforts

You can find a brief explainer on the research efforts here:

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.
