The Marine Mammal Acoustics and Spatial Ecology (MAPS) project was funded by BOEM and led by Drs. Doug Nowacek (Duke) and Ann Pabst (UNCW). The project had four components whose outputs are summarized in the <a href="https://ashleyblawas.github.io/assets/pdf/BOEM%20MAPS%20Report%202023.pdf" target="_blank">final project report</a>:


<ol>
  <li>Visual and passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) of cetaceans across a section of the Mid-Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf (OCS)</li>
  <li>Improvements to opensource tag visualization software</li>
  <li>Streamlining of citizen science data-gathering technologies, and</li>
   <li>Communication and outreach efforts</li>
</ol>

This work was conducted on <a href="https://www.marineconservationresearch.co.uk/rv-song-of-the-whale/">R/V Song of the Whale</a> (SOTW) during the winter and spring of 2019. I served as a visual observer on 2 two-week legs of the project aboard SOTW.
